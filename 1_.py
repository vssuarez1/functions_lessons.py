# Methods, Help & Documentation Practice #1
# Remove the characters to the left of our main text:

# ,

# :

# %

# _

# #

# Use the lstrip() method. Print the result to the screen:

# ",:_#,,,,,,:::____##Total_ _Pyt%on,,,,,,::#"

# Search the documentation for the requested method to learn how it works. You can use intermediate variables if you need them.


# Methods, Help & Documentation Practice #2
# Add the element "orange" as the fourth element of the following list fruits, using the insert() method:

# fruits = ["mango", "banana", "cherry", "plum", "grapefruit"]

# Search the documentation for the requested method to know how it works.

# Methods, Help & Documentation Practice #3
# Check if the sets below are isolated (that is, they have no elements in common), using the isdisjoint() method. Store this result in the isolated_sets variable:

# phone_brands = {"Samsung", "Xiaomi", "Apple", "Huawei", "LG"}
# tv_brands = {"Sony", "Philips", "Samsung", "LG"}
# Search the documentation for the requested method to know how it works.
